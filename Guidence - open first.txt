** Follow the tutorial, but keep download the latest

Then, here some dependencies need to be installed for running Flask API :
- python
- Flask
- TensorFlow (latest or 2.11)
- OpenCV
- numpy
- os

before install them, make sure build your python virtual environment
run this command to build venv (make sure run CLI terminal not PS / Power Shell) :
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

after venv activated, run this code for install dependencies :
pip install -r requirements.txt

This is guide to running this project.

1. Open 2 windows of VSCode
2. One window open flutter project and other one for open Flask API
3. Run flutter project by selecting main.dart then click run debugging or click F5. Other way you can run at command line by entering | flutter run |
4. Run Flask API by command line | python app.py |
5. You'll see local IP of flask server after run it, copy the IP ex: 192.168.0.10/5000 -> replace this line code with your local Flask IP
>> final Uri uri = Uri.parse('http://192.168.1.10:5000/upload');
>>                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ change it   
6. After all is runing already, make sure your emulator / phone is open the application
7. After the application is open, select input video (use sampel video or video from datasets)
8. There is button say procees video, click it and wait until the prediction appear
9. If wanted to input other video, just click select video button then process the video

Thanks for reading!

Note : This is on developing mode, not on build version. Cause utilize Flask API need the server online, which build version (offline in this case) cant utilize it.
